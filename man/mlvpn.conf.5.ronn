      - rtun_up: one tunnel changed status to up ($3 is the tunnel name)

    See the example file _mlvpn_updown.sh_ for more informations

  - _mode_ = "server"

    **MANDATORY**

    - "server": listen on _bind_address_, _bind_port_ for every tunnel
    - "client": connects to _remote_address_, _remote_port_ for every
      tunnel

  - _loglevel_ = 1
    Change the log level (0=errors, 1=info (recommanded), 2=debug)

  - _timeout_ = 30
    Timeout, expressed in seconds.

    Keepalive are send every timeout/2 seconds.

  - _interface_name_ = "mlvpn0"
    Set interface name to the specified value. (**LINUX ONLY**)

###Â TUNNELS
Each tunnel must be declared in it's own section.

    Address of the remote host. (client)

  - _remoteport_ = 5080
    Port of the remote host. (client)

  - _bandwidth_upload_ = 61440
    Maxiumm upload bandwidth, in bytes for this link.

    Bandwidth is specified in Bytes (1KiB = 1024Bytes).

    This is used to setup the weight round-robin balancing algorithm.
    Set 0 if both links are similar. (client/server)

  - _timeout_ = 25
    Override **[general]** timeout for this link. (client/server)

  - _fallback_only_ = 0
    Links defined with fallback_only will be connected at all times,
