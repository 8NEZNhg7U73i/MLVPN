mlvpn.conf(5) -- MLVPN configuration
====================================

## DESCRIPTION

See mlvpn(1) for more info on MLVPN.

## SYNTAX

mlvpn.conf(5) is a "ini style" config file.

Sections are surrounded with []. **[general]** for example.

Comments can be inserted anyware, starting with **#**.

Key / Values are written in plain ascii separated with the "=" character.
Example: loglevel = 4

Long strings should be escaped with doublequote.

## SECTIONS

Mandatory keys are marked with "(*)".

### GENERAL

The **[general]** sections is reserved by mlvpn(1) for global configuration.

Prameters:

  - (*) statuscommand = "/path/to/secured_updown_script.sh"
    This command is launched when mlvpn(1) detects a change:
      - mlvpn(1) **Tun/Tap** interface is ready.
      - mlvpn(1) **Tun/Tap** interface must be shut down.
      - mlvpn(1) remote tunnel is up
      - mlvpn(1) remote tunnel is down
    See the example mlvpn_updown.sh for more info.

  - (*) mode = "client" or "server"
    mlvpn(1) should act as a socket server or socket client?

  - (*) protocol = "udp" or "tcp"
    Prefer UDP for better performance.

  - logfile = "/path/to/mlvpn.log"
    Tells MLVPN where to store logfile.

  - loglevel = 3
    Change the log level.
    Valid values from **1** (quiet) to **4** (debug)

  - timeout = 30
    Integer value for detecting "link" timeout.

  - interface_name = "mlvpn0"
    Change the **Tun/Tap** interface name.

###Â LINKS

Each link must be declared in it's own section.

The section name is the link name. Example: "[adsl1]", "[adsl2]".

Parameters:

  - (both) bindhost = "0.0.0.0"
    Bind on a specific address. (IPv4 only)

  - (both) bindport = 5080
    Bind on a specific port. 

  - (client) remotehost = "1.2.3.4"
    Where to connect to.

  - (client) remoteport = 5080

  - (both) bandwidth_upload = 61440
    client => server max bandwidth used by mlvpn for this link.
    Bandwidth is specified in Bytes (1024 base).

  - (both) bandwidth_download = 512000
    server => client max bandwidth used by mlvpn for this link.
    Bandwidth is specified in Bytes (1024 base).

  - (both) timeout = 25
    Override **[general]** timeout for this link.

  - (both) protocol = 10
    Override **[general]** protocol for this link.

  - latency_increase = 40
    artificial latency increase expressed in milliseconds.
    This setting can be used to "match" latency of two links.
    Latency matching is very important because it will minimize packet
    reordering when MLVPN is used in a multi-link environment.
    If ping adsl1 to server  is ~ 120ms and adsl2 to server is ~ 200 ms
    then add half the difference: (200 - 120)/2 = 40
    This calculation can be wrong as the path from adsl1 to server
    can have a different latency than the server to adsl1 path.
